# BetterRoleDot

Discord has an accessibility setting that displays role colours as little dots next to usernames

Sadly, enabling it will make all names white. This plugin lets you have the best of both worlds, both the dot and the coloured names!

You can even click the dot to copy the role colour to your clipboard
